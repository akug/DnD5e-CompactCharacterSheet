# DnD5e-CompactCharacterSheet
Contains the svg and pdf for a compact, 2-page character sheet

The special thing about this sheet is that it contains a longer list of pre-formatted spell templates, such that you don't need a reference for your spells.
Especially neat when starting a game with new players, because constantly looking things up in the Players Handbook or online can be a bit overwhelming and distracting.

Based on a template I found online but could not find it again. Contact me if I should add a link to your website, or a copyright notice.
